	    <p id="post_text" class="post">I am a Sophomore attending Wentworth Institute of Technology studying Computer Information Systems with a Minor in Computer Science. As a Coding Instructor for Action for Boston Community Development(ABCD), I gained exceptional communication and time management skills. I was able to create a fun and engaging learning environment for the various students and Instructors I worked with. Teaching the classes helped nurture my Work Ethic, as I needed to come to each class session knowing what I would teach. While working at Resilient Coders I developed strong bonds with the clients I worked with. With every client, I tried to understand their desire for their project and worked according to their agenda, while keeping my work as detailed as possible. As someone who is dedicated to their work and preparing the best work to clients, I was at all times closely involved in everything that happened during the development of the client’s website. I take pride in organizing the client’s project and working out each step individually.</p>
